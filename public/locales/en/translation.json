    "testi1": "Usually I would pay our neighbours to come help till our field with tools. [DinRai's] lease is much cheaper than labour costs which we pay 3,000 baht for. - K'Yao, Vegetable Farmer, Rachaburi Province",
    "testi2": "We heard about DinRai through a my friend's shared message on LINE. The machines were in good condition. It was much cheaper than short-term rentals, and sharing it with my cousin through the system makes it even cheaper - Loong'Poon, Lime Farmer, Rachaburi Province",
    "testi3": "We usually hire the local tractor companies to till our 10-rai field, which would usually cost 4,000 baht. Long-term leasing hasn't caused any problems so far, and the cheaper prices are always great for us, because we do not have much cash. - K'Tum and Father, Vegetable Farmers, Rachaburi Province",
